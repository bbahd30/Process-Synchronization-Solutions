# Problem Statement
There is a bridge which is aligned along the left-right direction. This bridge is too narrow to allow cars to go in both directions. Hence, cars must alternate going across the bridge. The bridge is also not strong enough to hold more than three cars at a time. A solution is to be provided which does not cause starvation. That is, cars that want to get across should eventually get across. However, we want to maximize use of the bridge. Cars should travel across to the maximum capacity of the bridge (that is, three cars should go at one time). If a car leaves the bridge going left and there are no cars  going right, then the next left going car should be allowed to cross. Left going cars that are waiting should not wait until all three cars that are Leftbound and crossing the bridge have crossed before being permitted to cross.
